Optimizing high performance computing (HPC)/data centers, and applications
running at these centers presents a unique set of challenges, and an
opportunity to automate complex optimization tasks. The use of machine learning
and statistical techniques to model and characterize performance data is
gaining traction in the parallel community. The International Workshop on Data
Analytics and Parallel Performance provides a forum for sharing academic and
industrial research work focused on applying data analytics to performance
analysis, debugging and optimization/tuning of parallel software and systems.
